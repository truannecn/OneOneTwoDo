# Term Project 15112 -- One One Two Do
### Made by: Truanne Chen

### Description:
OneOneTwoDo is a productivity hub application that allows users to do various things that will contribute to their daily productivity. The app allows users to navigate through different screens starting from a landing page. The to-do list page will allow users to add, remove, and edit tasks. In the planner page, there is a task view where all of your tasks are displayed proportionally by the amount of time they take. On the other side is their daily view where they can add and edit events. Additionally, there is a timer page that allows users to implement the pomodoro method into their study sessions. Users would ideally be able to choose the amount of time they’d like to work, the amount of time they’d like to break, and the amount of time in total they would like to work for. The app should then be able to rotate through work and break timers until the end of the user’s work session. Furthermore, there is a scheduling feature where users can enter events for the day and there will be an algorithm that makes an optimized schedule as well as any leftover events that don’t fit into that current day.
